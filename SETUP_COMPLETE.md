# IPO Reminder Bot - Setup Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What's Been Completed

Your IPO Reminder Bot is now **fully operational** and automated! Here's what was set up:

### 🔧 Technical Setup
- ✅ Fixed all Python syntax errors and import issues
- ✅ Installed all required dependencies
- ✅ Configured Microsoft Graph API authentication
- ✅ Set up Azure App Registration with proper permissions
- ✅ Created GitHub repository with automated secrets
- ✅ Deployed GitHub Actions workflow for daily execution

### 📧 Email Configuration
- ✅ **Microsoft Graph API**: Primary email method using OAuth2
- ✅ **Email Address**: reddy.dinesh@live.com (sender and recipient)
- ✅ **Authentication**: Uses your Azure app registration credentials
- ✅ **Permissions**: Mail.Send permission granted with admin consent

### 🤖 Automation
- ✅ **Schedule**: Runs daily at 8:30 AM IST (3:00 AM UTC)
- ✅ **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflow deployment
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository

## 📱 What Happens Next

1. **Daily Execution**: The bot will automatically run every day at 8:30 AM IST
2. **IPO Detection**: It checks Chittorgarh.com for IPOs closing today
3. **Email Alerts**: If IPOs are found, you'll receive an email at reddy.dinesh@live.com
4. **No IPOs**: If no IPOs are closing, no email is sent (saves inbox clutter)
